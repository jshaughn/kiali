== Introduction

Kiali provides answers to the questions: _What microservices are part of my Istio service mesh and how are they connected?_

image::https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/kiali.io/master/static/images/features/graph-overview.png[Kiali Graph, width=480]

== Table of contents

toc::[]

=== Description

A Microservice Architecture breaks up the monolith into many smaller pieces that are composed together. Patterns to secure the communication between services like fault tolerance (via timeout, retry, circuit breaking, etc.) have come up as well as distributed tracing to be able to see where calls are going.

A service mesh can now provide these services on a platform level and frees the application writers from those tasks. Routing decisions are done at the mesh level.

Kiali works with Istio to visualise the service mesh topology, features like circuit breakers or request rates.

Kiali also includes Jaeger Tracing to provide distributed tracing out of the box.

=== Getting Started

If you are not a developer but just want to run something to see Kiali, then go to https://www.kiali.io for some instructions.

You could also try to use our hack script to quickly install OpenShift, Istio, and Kiali like this:

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/kiali/master/hack/cluster-openshift.sh
sh cluster-openshift.sh --kiali-enabled true up
```

If you do not already have an Istio-enabled application to test with, you can install one using the link:hack/istio/README.adoc[Bookinfo Demo install script] provided here as a convenience.

There are other demo applications to choose from as well: link:./DEMOS.adoc[see some examples].

=== Docker Image

Kiali is published as a docker image on https://hub.docker.com/r/kiali/kiali[Docker hub at kiali/kiali]

=== License and Copyright

See the link:./LICENSE[LICENSE file].

== Building

[NOTE]
These build instructions assume you have the following installed on your system: (1) link:http://golang.org/doc/install[Go Programming Language] which must be at least version 1.8.3, (2) link:http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git], (3) link:https://docs.docker.com/installation/[Docker], and (4) make. To run Kiali on OpenShift after you build it, it is assumed you have a running OpenShift environment available to you. If you do not, you can find a set of link:#setting-up-openshift[instructions on how to set up OpenShift below]. To run Kiali on Kubernetes after you built it, it is assumed you have a running Kubernetes environment available to you.

To build Kiali:

* Clone this repository inside a GOPATH. These instructions will use the example GOPATH of "/source/kiali/kiali" but you can use whatever you want. Just change the first line of the below instructions to use your GOPATH.

[source,shell]
----
export GOPATH=/source/kiali/kiali
mkdir -p $GOPATH
cd $GOPATH
mkdir -p src/github.com/kiali
cd src/github.com/kiali
git clone git@github.com:kiali/kiali
export PATH=${PATH}:${GOPATH}/bin
----

* Install Glide - the Go dependency management tool that Kiali uses to build itself

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make dep-install
----

* Tell the dependency manager tool to update the Kiali dependencies
[NOTE]
You should only run this command if you add, remove, or modify a dependency. If you are simply git cloning and building from source, you should skip this step.

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make dep-update
----

* Build Kiali

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make build
----

* At this point you can run the Kiali tests

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make test
----

== Running

[NOTE]
If you want to quickly get up and running to play with Kiali and do not wish to git clone the repository, or build anything, see https://kiali.org for instructions. If you do not have a cluster environment (e.g. OpenShift) yet, grab the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/kiali/master/hack/cluster-openshift.sh[cluster-openshift.sh] convenience script and run it to quickly start an OpenShift cluster environment with Istio installed. If you do not have a service mesh to test with, grab the link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kiali/kiali/master/hack/istio/install-bookinfo-demo.sh[install-bookinfo-demo.sh] convenience script to download and install the Istio Bookinfo Demo service mesh.

=== Secrets

*Note*: There is a secret variable in the configuration called *TOKEN_SECRET*, be careful with this secret.

=== Running on OpenShift

==== Setting up OpenShift

The following section assumes that the user has link:https://github.com/openshift/origin[OpenShift Origin] installed.

The link:https://docs.openshift.org/latest/welcome/index.html[OpenShift Origin Documentation] will outline all the steps required.

==== Building the Docker Image

Create the Kiali docker image through the "docker-build" make target:

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make docker-build
----

==== Deploying Kiali to OpenShift

[NOTE]
Before deploying and running Kiali, you must first install and deploy link:https://istio.io[Istio]. *Required Istio Version: 1.0*. There are a few places that you can reference in order to learn how to do this such as link:https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/istio-tutorial[here], link:https://blog.openshift.com/evaluate-istio-openshift/[here], and link:https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/quick-start.html[here].

[NOTE]
The following make targets assume that the `oc` command is available in the user's PATH and that the user is logged in. If you have `istiooc` instead, create a symlink in your PATH pointing `oc` to your `istiooc` binary.

The deploy and undeploy commands are automated in the Makefile. The following will undeploy an old installation of Kiali, if available, and deploy a new one:
----
make openshift-deploy
----

If you need to set the **JAEGER** or **GRAFANA** services, set the URL in the environment variable **JAEGER_URL** and **GRAFANA_URL**

==== Deploying Kiali to OpenShift with commands


==== Undeploying Kiali from OpenShift

If you want to remove Kiali from your OpenShift environment, you can do so by running the following command:

[source,shell]
----
make openshift-undeploy
----

==== Reloading Kiali image in OpenShift

If you already have Kiali installed but you want to recreate the pod with a new docker image, you can run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
make openshift-reload-image
----

=== Running on Kubernetes

==== Setting up Kubernetes

The following section assumes that the user has link:https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes[Kubernetes] installed.

==== Building the Docker Image

Create the Kiali docker image through the "docker-build" make target:

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make docker-build
----

Note that if you are using minikube, you can build the docker image and push it directly into the minikube docker daemon using the alternative make target `minikube-docker`:

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make minikube-docker
----

==== Deploying Kiali to Kubernetes

[NOTE]
Before deploying and running Kiali, you must first install and deploy link:https://istio.io[Istio]. *Required Istio Version: 1.0*. There are a few places that you can reference in order to learn how to do this such as link:https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/istio-tutorial[here], link:https://blog.openshift.com/evaluate-istio-openshift/[here], and link:https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/quick-start.html[here].

[NOTE]
The following make targets assume that the `kubectl` command is available in the user's PATH.

[NOTE]
In order to deploy on Kubernetes and to be able to access the deployed service, you must ensure you have Ingress support. If you are using minikube, you need to run `minikube addons enable ingress` and add `kiali` as a hostname in your `/etc/hosts` via something like this command: `echo "$(minikube ip) kiali" | sudo tee -a /etc/hosts`

The deploy and undeploy commands are automated in the Makefile. The following will undeploy an old installation of Kiali, if available, and deploy a new one:
----
make k8s-deploy
----

If you need to set the **JAEGER** or **GRAFANA** services, set the URL in the environment variable **JAEGER_URL** and **GRAFANA_URL**

==== Undeploying Kiali from Kubernetes

If you want to remove Kiali from your Kubernetes environment, you can do so by running the following command:

[source,shell]
----
make k8s-undeploy
----

==== Reloading Kiali image in Kubernetes

If you already have Kiali installed but you want to recreate the pod with a new docker image, you can run the following command:

[source,shell]
----
make k8s-reload-image
----

=== Running Standalone

Sometimes you may want to run Kiali outside of any container environment, perhaps for debugging purposes. To do this, run:

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make install
make run
----

The "install" target installs the Kiali executable in your GOPATH /bin directory so you can run it outside of the Makefile:

[source,shell]
----
cd ${GOPATH}/src/github.com/kiali/kiali
make install
${GOPATH}/bin/kiali -config <your-config-file>
----

== Configure External Services

=== Jaeger

To configure the Jaeger Service you need to expose the service and set the URL parameter in the config.yaml

[source,yaml]
----
external_services:
  jaeger:
    url: https://jaeger-query-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io
----

If you are using the Make task **openshift-deploy** or **k8s-deploy** you need to change in the **kiali-configmap.yaml** the value of the jaeger > url
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: kiali
  labels:
    app: kiali
    version: ${VERSION_LABEL}
data:

== Additional Notes

=== Customize the UI web context root

By default Kiali UI is deployed to the top level of `https://kiali-istio-system.<your_cluster_domain_or_ip>/`.  In some situation such as when you want to serve Kiali UI along with other apps under the same host name, e.g., `example.com/kiali`, `example.com/app1`, you can edit Kiali Config Map and provide a different value for `web_root`.  Note: the path must begin with a `/`.

An example of custom web root:

[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 20001
  web_root: /kiali
external_services:
  jaeger:
  ...
----

=== Running the UI Outside the Core

When developing the http://github.com/kiali/kiali-ui[Kiali UI] you will find it useful to run it outside of the core to make it easier to update the UI code and see the changes without having to recompile. The prefered approach for this is to use a proxy on the UI to mount the core. The process is described https://github.com/kiali/kiali-ui#developing[here].

To connect with the backend and avoid the javascript prompt requesting authentication you need to send the requests with a specific header.
[source]
----
X-Auth-Type-Kiali-UI: 1
----
The response will contain the header
[source]
----
WWW-Authenticate: xBasic realm="Kiali"
----
Otherwise the header will be
[source]
----
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Kiali"
----

=== Running A Locally Built UI Inside the Core

If you are developing the UI on your local machine but you want to see it deployed and running inside of the core server, you can do so by setting the environment variable CONSOLE_VERSION to the value "local" when building the docker image via the `docker-build` target. By default, your UI's build/ directory is assumed to be in a directory called `kiali-ui` that is a peer directory of the GOPATH root directory for the core server. If it is not, you can set the environment variable CONSOLE_LOCAL_DIR to the value of the path of the root directory for the UI such that `$CONSOLE_LOCAL_DIR/build` contains the generated build files for the UI.

For example, if your GOPATH directory for the Kiali project is `/source/kiali/kiali` and you have git cloned the Kiali UI repository in `/source/kiali/kiali-ui` then you do not need to set CONSOLE_LOCAL_DIR. You can embed your locally built console into the core docker image via:

[source,shell]
----
CONSOLE_VERSION=local make docker-build
----

If you git cloned the Kiali UI repository in directory `/my/git/repo` and have built the UI there (such that the build files are located at `/my/git/repo/build`) then you can embed that locally built console into the core docker image via:

[source,shell]
----
CONSOLE_VERSION=local CONSOLE_LOCAL_DIR=/my/git/repo make docker-build
----

=== Disabling SSL
In the provided OpenShift templates, SSL is turned on by default. If you want to turn it off, you should:
* Remove the "tls: termination: reencrypt" option in Kiali route
* Remove the "identity" block, with certificate paths, in Kiali Config Map.
* Optionnally you can also remove the annotation "service.alpha.openshift.io/serving-cert-secret-name", and the related volume that is declared and mounted in Kiali Deployment (but if you don't, they will just be ignored).

=== Running Kiali with commands

==== Download the files and configure
[NOTE]
Before deploying and running Kiali, you must first install and deploy link:https://istio.io[Istio]. *Required Istio Version: 1.0*. There are a few places that you can reference in order to learn how to do this such as link:https://github.com/redhat-developer-demos/istio-tutorial[here], link:https://blog.openshift.com/evaluate-istio-openshift/[here], and link:https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/quick-start.html[here].

[NOTE]
The following make targets assume that the `oc` command is available in the user's PATH and that the user is logged in. If you have `istiooc` instead, create a symlink in your PATH pointing `oc` to your `istiooc` binary.
